# **Pyber_Analysis**

## **Overview of the Analysis**

### This analysis was conducted to examine the 2019 data from Pyber. The goal  was to inspect these data and summarize them by arranging them into data frames. Specifically, this analysis wanted to find out the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and, average fare per driver for different city types. This was done to help PyBer company with its decision-making process.

## **Results**

#### Rural cities have the least number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares while urban cities have the most number in those parameters. Furthermore, rural cities have higher average fare per ride and per driver than suburban and urban cities. It can be inferred that having large number of drivers means higher amount of total fares, as seen in urban cities. This also tantamounts to lower average fare per ride and driver.
