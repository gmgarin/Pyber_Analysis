# **PyBer_Analysis**

## **Overview of the Analysis**

### This analysis was conducted to examine the 2019 data from Pyber. The goal  was to inspect these data and summarize them by arranging them into data frames. Specifically, this analysis wanted to find out the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and, average fare per driver for different city types. This was done to help PyBer company with its decision-making process.

## **Results**

### After careful analysis, the following results were obtained.
#### *Ride-sharing data per city type*

### Rural cities have the least number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares while urban cities have the most number in those parameters. Furthermore, rural cities have higher average fare per ride and per driver than suburban and urban cities. It can be inferred that having large number of drivers means higher amount of total fares, as seen in urban cities. This also tantamounts to lower average fare per ride and driver. 

## **Summary**

### The data showed how the number of drivers correlates poorly with the average fare per ride and driver. This means that earnings of drivers in both urban and suburban cities are generally and significantly lower than those drivers in rural cities. One suggestion that could address earnings disparity among different city types of drivers is hiring more drivers in rural cities. By doing so, PyBer can also meet the demand for rides during peak hours in rural communities. This can also shorten customer wait times for rides during these hours and might improve customer's overall experience. While this suggestion is based on the available data from PyBer, I believe that more data is needed to fully address the earnings disparity among PyBer ride-share drivers. Such data can include average distance per ride and average trip duration.
